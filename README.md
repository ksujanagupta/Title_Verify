#Title Verification System Prototype:- #Overview:- This project is a basic prototype for a Title Verification System, allowing users to input a title and check its similarity against the existing titles in the database. #Features:- Input as Text: Users can enter a title as text and submit it. File Upload (Coming Soon): A button allows users to attempt file uploads. Title generator(Our unique feature): We have also added a feature where it generates a title for the context given by the user. Result: After submitting a text title, you can view the status(accepted/rejected) and the probability score of given title. Currently, the system supports text input and provides placeholders for future functionality. #Technologies Used:- HTML: Structure of the web page. CSS: Basic styling for the layout and buttons. JavaScript: Handles the interaction logic between different input modes. #Deployment:- This project is deployed using GitHub pages(as it is currently a static website). #Fututre Plans:- File Input Processing: Implement file handling. Backend Integration: Connect the frontend to a backend API to handle title verification logic and probability scoring. A dynamic and interactive website: Right now we have built it using html,css,javascript but we intend to move to React for a dynamic, interactive and more enhanced website.
