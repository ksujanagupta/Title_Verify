# Title Verification System Prototype

## Overview

This project is a basic prototype for a Title Verification System, allowing users to input a title and check its similarity against the existing titles in the database.

## Features

- **Input as Text**: Users can enter a title as text and submit it.
- **File Upload (Coming Soon)**: A button allows users to attempt file uploads.
- **Result**: After submitting a text title, you can view the status (accepted/rejected) and the probability score of the given title.
- **Title Generation(Unique Feature)**: A feature which can be used to generate titles based on the context given by user.

Currently, the system supports text input and provides placeholders for future functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Basic styling for the layout and buttons.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the interaction logic between different input modes.

## Deployment

This project is deployed using GitHub Pages (as it is currently a static website).

## Future Plans

- **File Input Processing**: Implement file handling.
- **Backend Integration**: Connect the frontend to a backend API to handle title verification logic and probability scoring.
- **A dynamic and interactive website**: Right now we have built it using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, but we intend to move to React for a dynamic, interactive, and more enhanced website.
